# HOW TO:

Upload file with curl:
curl http://localhost:6767/api/v1/ipfs/add-file -F "file=@/home/solidity/go/src/github.com/RTradeLtd/Temporal/README.md" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"


# TO DO:

Virus scan files that are uploaded before storage onto ipfs

Write smart contract fo facilitate storage:
    > must contain user accounts
        > each user account must contain a valid balance
        > when uploading a file specify duration, the user accoun must contain enough RTC to pay for the entire duration

Optimize RAFT consensus, and other cluster factors
